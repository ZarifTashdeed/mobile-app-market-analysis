## Project Overview
Mobile apps dominate our daily lives, but not all apps are profitable.  
In this project, I explored datasets from the **Apple App Store** and **Google Play Store** to answer questions like:
- Which app categories attract the most users?  
- Are free apps or paid apps more profitable?  
- What trends can guide developers toward building sustainable apps?  



## Tools & Skills
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- Data cleaning & wrangling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization for insights  



## Key Insights
- Certain categories (e.g., Games, Social, Productivity) dominate downloads.  
- Free apps often gain traction faster, but monetization strategies matter.  
- Data-driven decision-making is essential for app development success.
